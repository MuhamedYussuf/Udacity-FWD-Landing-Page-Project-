# Landing Page Project
I don't know why my project got plagiarized! Even though I did it with my own, I worked hard to make the changes and submitting it again. I hope this project will be accepted.

## Brief through the steps I did
 *  Queried all sections and store the list in variable.
 *  created a list items and anchors using for each loop to bild a navigation-bar.
 *  Made a Smooth Scroll. 
 *  Tried to add and remove link based on activity using getBoundingClintRect.
